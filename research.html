      <em>System Design</em> is a widely used methodology concerned with aiding
      the prototyping process in order to reduce costs and time. It has several
      names depending on the field of application such as System Engineering,
      Model Based Design etc, but the underlying idea is always the same.<br>
      Another useful methodology which is closely linked with the System Design
      is the <em>System Identification</em>. They are different faces of the
      same medal. The common idea is to build a mathematical
      object/computational model, called (in silico) model, which is able to
      simulate the behavior of a real system in order to describe it (System
      Identification) or to build it (System Design) [BS13].<br>
      <br>
      My research is focused on System Design problems aimed at estimating the
      parameters of a target model so that it satisfies some
      requirements/specifications. That methodology is commonly used in
      Synthetic and System Biology where the systems (and therefor the models)
      are mainly stochastic and highly noisy, or to describe
      Cyber-Physical-Systems [Lee08,Jensen11] or more generally complex systems.<br>
      The use of quantitative formal methods in System Design framework has
      increased rapidly in the last few years, starting from Biology and
      continuing in the industrial field such as aerospace and automotive
      sectors, where the quality and compliance of the end product are of
      paramount importance. <br>
      In the automotive field, in particular, the models are described by using
      block diagram tools (i.e Simulink, Gt Suite) which are mainly
      deterministic and highly complex to verify.<br>
      In this research I have considered both the stochastic and the
      deterministic cases. <br>
      In the first case Chemical Reaction Networks (CRNs, [Gillespie77]) have
      been considered and the requirements have been expressed by using Signal
      Temporal Logic (STL, [Maler04]). The goal was to maximize the probability
      of satisfaction of target formulas. <br>
      The reason for considering such Temporal Logic Formalism to describe the
      requirements is twofold. Firstly, this formalism is able to capture the
      emergent properties of a system, which is a natural approach from the
      modeling point of view. Secondly, it is suitable for expressing the
      requirements in a rigorous way, so that computers can directly interpret
      them. Several model checkers capable of verifying different temporal logic
      formalism exist.<br>
      In [BPS16] a multi-objective approach to the design of CRNs using STL has
      been considered. It is quite common in the System Design Process to have
      conflicting requirements, where conflicting means that increasing the
      satisfiability of a given requirement entails the decrease of another. The
      multi-objective approach manages that situation by introducing a very
      natural relation of dominance. One model is preferable to (dominates)
      another one if its performance with respect to each requirement is better;
      otherwise the two models are in a non-dominated relation. The
      multi-objective approach has the goal of finding all the non dominated
      points that compose the so called Pareto Front (see. [Deb01]). After
      having proved (by means of simulations) that this approach is reasonable
      for the CRNs, a combined approach of quantitative and qualitative
      semantics to find the Pareto front has been considered. Using that
      combination we have defined a new relation of Pareto dominance and the
      results show that this definition can speed up the performance of a
      genetic algorithm to reach the Pareto front in terms of less evaluations.
      An interesting outcome of this research consists in showing the limitation
      of the robustness semantics that we call <em>the length scale problem</em>.
      The criticism is referred to its sensitiveness with respect to the length
      scale of the atomic predicates. In fact, the robustness semantics combines
      the values of predicates contained in a formula (i.e a conjunctive clause)
      in a way that may not be fully meaningful if their robustness length scale
      is different. This entails that the falsification algorithm considers only
      the predicates with larger robustness length scale and ignores others
      producing sub-optimal results, ( see [BPS16]).<br>
      The other part of my research has been focused on the falsification of
      block diagram models (such as Simulink) which are largely used in control
      applications (automotive, aerospace, etc). They are difficult to verify
      because of their complexity (consider that a basic industrial model could
      contain several switch blocks, look-up tables and encapsulated hybrid
      systems). For this reason standard model checking techniques are most of
      the time unfeasible. Those kinds of model take as inputs time varying
      quantities (such as temporal series i.e throttle and brake angle dynamics)
      and produce as outputs temporal series (such as engine speed, gear
      dynamics etc). The falsification problem consists in finding an input, if
      any, which causes a bug in the target model, expressed as falsification of
      a given STL formula. That input is called counterexample. It is possible
      to determine counterexamples by means of optimization where the simple
      idea consists in minimizing the robustness of the STL specification by
      changing the inputs temporal series and stopping the process as soon as a
      counterexample has been found (it will have negative robustness). We have
      tackled this problem by handling the model as a black box, meaning that is
      not possible to look inside the model but it is only possible to observe
      input and output temporal series. On the one hand, this choice is a
      limitation because no abstraction or model transformation is possible and
      this increases the difficulty of falsifying the system. On the other hand,
      the general applicability of the proposed process increases enormously
      because of its independence of the target model. The main difficulties
      here consist in efficiently parameterizing the input temporal series and
      considering optimization algorithms which are able to find a
      counterexample with the lowest number of evaluations. In [Silvetti16] we
      have modified the fixed control point parameterization [Fainekos12] and
      used a Gaussian Process Upper Confidence Bound (GP-UCB, [Srinivas12])
      optimizer in order to overcome the two aforementioned difficulties. The
      results in terms of the minimum number of evaluations needed to find a
      counterexample are good if compared with the state of the art S-Taliro,
      [Fainekos12]. The other advantages of using Gaussian Processes (or other
      statistical techniques) is their ability to provide statistical guarantees
      about the non falsifiability of black box models which admit inputs in a
      countable set. In fact, the falsifiability of black box models is a
      semi-decidible problem given that no abstraction techniques can be
      applied. The GPs can link the number of failed attempts at falsifying a
      model with the probability that this model is not falsifiable. This
      statistical property is closely related to the assumption of regularity we
      are making about the black box model, or similarly with the relation
      between the variation of the robustness semantics with respect to the
      variation in the input signals. For example, in the automotive field where
      Simulink is widely used, even if the models are highly complex we know
      that for sufficiently close input signals the system will generate outputs
      with similar robustness. The input functions which violate that assumption
      will be of measure zero (after having defined an appropriate measure). <br>
